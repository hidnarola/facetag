<p><span style="color: #141823;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="color: #555555;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Effective date: 14 March 2017</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #555555;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Welcome to Facetag ("Facetag," "we," "us" or "our"). Facetag provides a fast, fun and convenient way for providers of experiences, attractions, hospitality or events (&ldquo;Businesses&rdquo;) to share free of charge or offer for sale the photographs they take of your experience directly with you. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #555555;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">At the heart of the technology behind Facetag are biometric facial recognition and device location algorithms that enable us to deliver potential photo matches from an experience provider directly to your device. You are able to &ldquo;verify&rdquo; or &ldquo;decline&rdquo; every biometric match. You can then purchase (if required by the experience provider) and share by posting directly to your favourite social media.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then Facetag will access your contacts list to determine whether or not someone associated with your contact is using Facetag.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads.

</li>
<li>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The use of image and device geotag technology to manage the efficiency of facial recognition searches and matching on our database is essential to our service. </span></span></span></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content.

</li>
<li>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.</span></span></span></p>
