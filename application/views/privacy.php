		Welcome to <a href="">facetag</a> ("Facetag," "we," "us" or "our"). Facetag provides a fast, fun and convenient way for providers of experiences, attractions, hospitality or events (“Businesses”) to share free of charge or offer for sale the photographs they take of your experience directly with you.
	</p>
	<p>
            At the heart of the technology behind Facetag are biometric facial recognition and device location algorithms that enable us to deliver potential photo matches from an experience provider directly to your device. You are able to “verify” or “decline” every biometric match. You can then purchase (if required by the experience provider) and share by posting directly to your favourite social media.
